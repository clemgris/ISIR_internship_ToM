# ISIR_internship_ToM

This repository contains the research work conducted during an internship at the ISIR lab of Sorbonne University (April 2023 - September 2023). The objective of this internship was to validate an engineering degree from Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and the research master's degree MVA (Mathématiques Vision et Apprentissage) from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris-Saclay.

The research work focused on the implementation of Theory of Mind mechanisms within a reinforcement learning framework, aimed at optimizing the relevance of a demonstration provided by a teacher to a particular learner. The internship explored the use of Bayesian models and deep neural network approaches in simple setups extracted from cognitive science literature.
